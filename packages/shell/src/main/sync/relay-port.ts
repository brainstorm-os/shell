/**
 * Stage 10.3a — relay port + in-process loopback implementation.
 *
 * The relay handles ONE shape: opaque bytes (one encoded `EncryptedFrame`
 * per `send`). It does NOT decode, does NOT verify, does NOT decrypt. The
 * structural CI fence at `tools/mcp-server/src/tools/relay-noble-import-check.ts`
 * pins this invariant — production relay modules MUST NOT import any crypto library,
 * the envelope seal, anything from `../credentials/`, or `node:crypto`.
 *
 * `LoopbackRelayPort` is the in-process fan-out used by tests + the
 * single-vault wire path within one shell instance: every connected port
 * rebroadcasts to every OTHER connected port on `send`. The "other"
 * filter uses per-port identity (a minted internal id), not sender
 * pubkey — the relay is not allowed to read sender at all.
